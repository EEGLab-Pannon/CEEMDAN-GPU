# CEEMDAN-GPU
This repo contains our CUDA implementation of the Improved CEEMDAN algorithm. The original algorithm is described in

and implemented in MATLAB available at http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/patrick.flandrin/emd.html 

Our version achieves several orders of magnitude higher speed compared to the MATLAB implementation, reducing the execution time from hours (even days) to seconds.
